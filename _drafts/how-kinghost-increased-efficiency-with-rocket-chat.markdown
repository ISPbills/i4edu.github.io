# **THE CHALLENGE**

# Increasing communication speed and minimizing inefficiencies with emails.

In 2016, KingHost's team was heavily using emails for internal communications. However, as an ever-growing tech company, they needed to communicate and get feedback on projects quicker. As a solution, they invested in an instant messaging tool based on XMPP protocol.

**But to everyone's surprise, it failed to deliver.** The XMPP protocol tool didn't provide basic features such as group chats. It only allowed one-on-one conversations, making it difficult for larger teams to collaborate. They also spotted bugs that quickly led to the tool's unpopularity.

Before they knew it, everyone was using emails to transmit sensitive data. Their 12 months of trying to adopt a new communication tool had gone to waste.

# **THE SOLUTION**

## ✔️ 70% decrease in email volume, fewer meetings, and quicker interaction.

Apart from the rest of the company, the IT team decided to use Rocket.Chat's Team collaboration to centralize their communication in a single space. Because the platform is encrypted and focused on data privacy, the IT team could rely on a secure infrastructure.

Their time savings and efficiency were so remarkable that they sold the idea to the rest of the company. Teams including Marketing and HR adopted Rocket.Chat as their collaboration & communication platform.

# Fear of change & trial period: How did the company implement Rocket.Chat?

Using a new messaging platform worried managers. They were afraid it could be hard to incentivize people to adopt a new tool.

In order to experiment Rocket.Chat, the teams replaced their old chatting tool and implemented Rocket.Chat throughout the company to test it.

# Feedback: How the teams ended up loving Rocket.Chat

Quickly, they knew that the feedback received was great. Rocket.Chat was adopted by nearly 100% of the company, validating the platform to be used as KingHost team’s main chatting tool.

KingHost's team uses two major channels to communicate: strategic decisions and Hosting news. However, they encourage everyone to create their own discussions, without any constraints.

Besides that, Rocket.Chat's integrations made it possible to manage information quickly and efficiently in an organized manner. Thanks to it, webhooks were created to let teams know about important topics.![TESTIMONIAL (5).png](/uploads/TESTIMONIAL%20(5).png)

Even Quality Assurance has improved: Support analysts receive posts and new documentation about QA changes in their very own Rocket.Chat's platform.
