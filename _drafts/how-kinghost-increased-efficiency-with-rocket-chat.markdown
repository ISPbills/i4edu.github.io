<h2 style="color:indigo;">A quick overview of how the third-largest hosting company in Brazil uses Rocket.Chat to boost its efficiency</h2>

Being in business for over 13 years, [KingHost](https://king.host/) is a well-known technology provider for website hosting, email marketing, e-commerce hosting, cloud hosting, and marketing automation.

Acquired in 2019 by Locaweb, the leader in Latin America for hosting services, communication plays an essential role to maintain market leadership. Let's dive into their challenges and how Rocket.Chat helped the company to improve increase efficiency in 70%.

## The Challenge

## ⬆️ Increasing communication speed and minimizing inefficiencies with emails

In 2016, KingHost's team was heavily using emails for internal communications. However, as an ever-growing tech company, they needed to communicate and get feedback on projects quicker. As a solution, they invested in an instant messaging tool based on XMPP protocol.

**But to everyone's surprise, it failed to deliver.** The XMPP protocol tool didn't provide basic features such as group chats. It only allowed one-on-one conversations, making it difficult for larger teams to collaborate. They also spotted bugs that quickly led to the tool's unpopularity.

Before they knew it, everyone was using emails to transmit sensitive data. Their 12 months trying to adopt a new communication tool had gone to waste.

## The Solution

## ✔️ 70% decrease in email volume, fewer meetings, and quicker interaction.

Apart from the rest of the company, the IT team decided to use Rocket.Chat's Team collaboration to centralize their communication in a single space. Because the platform is encrypted and focused on data privacy, the IT team could rely on a secure infrastructure.

Their time savings and efficiency were so remarkable that they sold the idea to the rest of the company. Teams including Marketing and HR adopted Rocket.Chat as their collaboration & communication platform.
