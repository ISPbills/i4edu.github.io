## Seeking high-security alternatives to Zoom? Check out how Rocket.Chat ensures privacy in your video calls

As companies experience the outbreak of COVID-19, youâ€™re likely holding team meetings with Zoom, Skype or similar applications. While Coronavirus made these applications popular, it also exposed serious [privacy issues](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/technology/new-york-attorney-general-zoom-privacy.html?searchResultPosition=1) and [security](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/5/21208636/zoom-ceo-yuan-security-privacy-concerns) problems.

Many remote companies trust proprietary-code platforms, such as Skype or Zoom, to communicate online. Although easily accessible, they do not disclose how they actually function; they are often vague about how they technically handle user privacy and how your data is secured (or often not secured). By using these applications, you take the risk of:

Being Zoombombed in a private call (when random strangers may join your video call)

Having your data routed out of the country and in turn not following data privacy laws such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA. 

How to find a safe platform for video calls?

When looking for a private and secured platform for video calls, you should insist on a few details: 

Transparency in the form of open-source code 
So everyone understands how the platform works, and global security experts can examine and test the code upon every single release (and they DO because leading research institutions and security organizations are users of Rocket.Chat )
Full control over your own configuration; no need to share  with thousands of other companies
Secure encryption options available
