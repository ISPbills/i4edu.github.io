The arrival of COVID-19 in Brazil brought serious challenges to states, city halls, and the federal government: how to optimize healthcare services to the population, without overloading the health system and reducing the pace of contagion?

Rocket.Chat partnered with Amazon and other players to provide a solution for that: a digital assistance platform to help Brazilians diagnose the virus quickly and easily.

**Expected to reach nearly 30 million Brazilians**, the joint platform is already in operation in the state of Ceará, Bahia, Alagoas, and Espírito Santo, in addition to a few other cities.

## What is Rocket.Chat's Digital Assistance Platform for COVID-19?

Through an AI bot, we created a multichannel platform that manages to do screening, guidance, and teleconsultations through different channels, including Whatsapp, Facebook, or inserting a live chat on websites.

**The platform aims to:**

* Answer questions about the virus and its symptoms

* Inform the population about treatment programs nearby

* Monitor the evolution of COVID-19 disease in cases where it is necessary

* Provide healthcare service according to each individual's symptoms

* Provide a secure video call tool to connect people to doctors in order to treat  urgent cases

## Main benefits:

✔️ Assistance to hundreds of thousands of people through multiple channels, a health system "unburdened" and health professionals protected with social distancing.

✔️ Fast Implementation. Up to 5 days: this is the period required for states and municipalities to have the system ready.

✔️ High-Security & Data Privacy. Tested and licensed by Amazon, the solution follows international standards of data encryption and information privacy. The information is stored on individual servers, divided by State or Municipality, in Brazil.

## How does the platform work?

Using Rocket.Chat's open-source environment (with a transparent and flexible code for integrations), the communication platform is adaptable for the health system of cities and states with a population of over 500 thousand residents.

These are the usual steps taken in order to adopt the platform:

**Step 1)** System implementation. There is no need for digital proficiency at this step since it can be customized and configured according to the resources and preferences of each city.

**Step 2)** States and Municipalities disclose a service number via Whatsapp, Facebook, or inserting the live chat feature at their websites. No public data is needed other than the state or city hall number for the purpose of being contacted by residents.

**Step 3)** Through a feature called omnichannel, people are allowed to contact the platform as they prefer. For instance: by website, Facebook or Whatsapp.

**Step 4)** Bela, the bot developed to provide assistance, manages conversations on the platform. Developed in accordance with World Health Organization and Unicef protocols, Bela categorizes each patient according to their answers to previous questions regarding symptoms.

**Step 5)** If the symptoms are severe, a human assistant takes the case and performs a new screening to understand levels of risk of contagion.

**Step 6)** According to the patient's condition, a video call with the doctor is scheduled through a link sent to the resident later.

**Step 7)** The teleconsultation is recorded and the CRM receives key-information for auditing, internal controls, and secure storage in accordance with data protection and privacy laws.

\*\*Step 8) \*\*Each resident receives a unique and confidential identification and the history is recorded in the CRM system, developed by Konecty. As a step further, health public managers can access that information through dashboards and reports of risk analysis by micro-region.

**"We make daily reports to the crisis committee linked to the governor or mayor and complete dashboards to monitor the scenarios, mainly due to the ability to generate welcoming campaigns by micro-region."**

Leandro Coletti, Head of Revenue at Rocket.Chat

## How long does it take to implement the platform?

The entire system is ready to be deployed in less than 5 days, in a scalable way, to hundreds of thousands of people with the support of Amazon Brazil.

## How many people might be impacted by the platform?

On average, from 2% to 5% of the population from a Brazilian state and from 5% to 15% in the average municipalities may be treated by our communication platform. In total, we expect about 30 million people to be impacted in Brazil.

## What is the service capacity of the platform?

Designed to answer more than 100,000 queries about doubts, screening, and support, the platform is completely scalable if necessary.

## After implementing the platform, how is the data handled?

Thanks to the data processing system given by [Konecty's CRM:](https://konecty.com/)

* Each patient receives a unique ID, which stores the data to track the progress of each case individually. 

* **This ensures that states and cities manage confidential information with high-privacy standards.**

* The history is saved in real time, allowing health care managers to map and analyse it later.

* The information collected can be used in a confidential manner for the analysis of effectiveness within each state or municipality.

* For instance: *How many cases were treated*? *How many consultations were optimized or saved due to the teleservice*? **All of these are pertinent questions answered by our solution.**

## How can you implement the solution in your country or region as well?

Rocket.Chat is working on translating and adapting the solution for other countries and places outside Brazil. If you want to receive more information, please get in touch with us [by clicking here](https://rocket.chat/contact?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=covid-19).

We will be happy to discuss how the platform can benefit your particular environment.
