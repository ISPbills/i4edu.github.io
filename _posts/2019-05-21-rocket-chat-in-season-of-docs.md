We are happy to announce our participation in Season of Docs 2019! This is the inauguration year for the exciting new program.

Season of Docs is Google's annual program that fosters collaboration between open source projects and technical writers.

Season of Docs is a unique program that pairs technical writers with open source mentors to introduce the technical writer to an open source community and provide guidance while the writer works on a real world open source project. The technical writer in turn provides documentation expertise to the open source organization.

Spend three months working closely with Rocket.Chat’s mentors and community. Bring your technical writing expertise to the open source project's documentation. Learn about open source and new technologies. Find out more about Google Season of Docs at its [Official Page](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/).
