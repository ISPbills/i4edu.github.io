We have seen lots of companies sharing their thoughts on the current situation. But we haven’t seen many people talk about what they’re actually doing.

This webinar will share hacks and best practices used internally by Rocket.Chat which successfully keeps our remote team thriving.


**In this webinar, you will learn how to:**

- Ensure your communication follows a high-privacy standard
- Optimize your settings, and profile status
- Make the most of async and sync conversations
- Organize online discussions in a productive way

**Where**: Rocket.Chat’s Youtube channel (an email will be sent with the final link to join the webinar)
